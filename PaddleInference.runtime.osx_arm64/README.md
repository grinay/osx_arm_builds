# PaddleInference for Apple Silicon (ARM64)

This package includes a version of PaddlePaddle's C inference library, specifically compiled for Apple Silicon processors (ARM64). It ensures smooth operation on CPU, with GPU support not available for OSX ARM in this build.

The library is designed to work seamlessly, especially when used with the Sdcb.PaddleInference package, a .NET wrapper for PaddlePaddle. This package aims to provide a hassle-free integration experience for Apple Silicon users.

To get started, make sure your development environment is set up correctly. For more information, tips, and the opportunity to contribute to the project, visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/grinay/).

Please note that while this package is tailored for Apple Silicon, it does not include GPU support for OSX ARM as it is not yet available from the Paddle team.
